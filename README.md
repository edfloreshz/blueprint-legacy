## Description

The Blueprint project focuses on improving the initial experience developers have when starting to work with a new codebase or project. We understand that the initial setup and configuration can often be time-consuming and frustrating, leading to delays in productivity and a steep learning curve for newcomers. Our goal is to streamline this process and provide developers with a seamless out-of-the-box experience.

## Features

- **Automated setup**: We provide an easy to use interface to create, edit and distribute custom setups with other developers, reducing the time and effort required to setup a new machine.
- **Default configuration**: We have carefully curated default configurations for common tools, languages, and libraries used in the project. This ensures that developers can quickly get started without spending excessive time on configuration tweaks.

## Installation and Usage

To benefit from the Blueprint project and improve your out-of-the-box experience, download the app from Flathub.
